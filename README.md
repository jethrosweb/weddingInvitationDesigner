# weddingInvitationDesigner
Requirements:

- Couples should be able to choose between 3 possible invitation styles. Upon selecting a design, the screen should instantly update with the new look-and-feel
- Couples should be provided the appropriate input fields so that they can put in their vital data. Data, as it is entered, should appear inside the currently active look-and-feel.
- If you can think of ways to improve user experience, please do so! Our stressed couples appreciate thoughtful user experience (UX) that helps soother their addled nerves and nervous bank accounts
- Be Creative! If you want to corner the market on Goth-asthetic invitations, DO IT. If you think that super-kawaii anime invitations are your fast-track to riches and wealth MAKE IT HAPPEN. Remember this goes in your portfolio. Make sure your work is authentic and true to you.
